## 1. Features

With the help of the Logitech Harmony Hub devices can be operated, which are otherwise controllable via IR remote controls or even newer devices such as FireTV and AppleTV which are controlled via Bluetooth.
For more information about controllable devices through the Logitech Harmony Hub, see [Logitech Harmony Elite](https://www.logitech.com/de-de/product/harmony-elite "Logitech Harmony Elite")

Using the module, the devices stored in the Logitech Harmony Hub can be imported into IP-Symcon and then switched from IP-Symcon via the Logitech Harmony Hub.
Harmony activities can be started from IP-Symcon. When the Harmony Hub performs an activity, the current running activity is submitted to IP-Symcon.

### send IR Code :  

 - Send an IR signal through the Logitech Harmony Hub to the hub known devices 

### FireTV:  (Bluetooth)

 - Sending commands to a FireTV   

### Show current activity:  

 - Shows the current active Harmony Hub activity 
 
### Start an activity:  

 - Starts an activity of the Harmony Hub  
	  
## 2. Requirements

- IPS 5.x.
- Logitech Harmony Hub on the same network as IP Symcon
- XMPP activated in the Harmony app

## 3. Installation

### a. Enable XMPP in the Harmony app

Open the Harmony app and then enable XMPP under _Harmony Setup -> Add and Edit Devices and Actions -> Remote Control / Keyboard and Hub -> Enable XMPP_.

### b. Loading the module

Open the IP Console's web console with _http://<IP-Symcon IP>:3777/console/_.

Then click on the module store (IP-Symcon > 5.1) icon in the upper right corner.

![Store](img/store_icon.png?raw=true "open store")

In the search field type

```
Logitech Harmony
```  


![Store](img/module_store_search_en.png?raw=true "module search")

Then select the module and click _Install_

![Store](img/install_en.png?raw=true "install")


#### Install alternative via Modules instance

_Open_ the object tree.

![Objektbaum](img/object_tree.png?raw=true "object tree")	

Open the instance _'Modules'_ below core instances in the object tree of IP-Symcon (>= Ver 5.x) with a double-click and press the _Plus_ button.

![Modules](img/modules.png?raw=true "modules")	

![Plus](img/plus.png?raw=true "Plus")	

![ModulURL](img/add_module.png?raw=true "Add Module")
 
Enter the following URL in the field and confirm with _OK_:


```	
https://github.com/Wolbolar/IPSymconHarmony 
```
    
and confirm with _OK_.    
    
Then an entry for the module appears in the list of the instance _Modules_

By default, the branch _master_ is loaded, which contains current changes and adjustments.
Only the _master_ branch is kept current.

![Master](img/master.png?raw=true "master") 

If an older version of IP-Symcon smaller than version 5.1 (min 4.3) is used, click on the gear on the right side of the list.
It opens another window,

![SelectBranch](img/select_branch_en.png?raw=true "select branch") 

here you can switch to another branch, for older versions smaller than 5.1 (min 4.3) select _Old-Version_ .

### c. Configuration in IPS

If scripts are to be created, they will be placed below a category. First, we create a category in the object tree _right mouse button -> add object -> category_, which we give an arbitrary name such as. _**Harmony devices**_.
Later, all scripts for devices of the Logitech Harmony Hub will be created under this category.

Then add an instance in IP-Symcon 5.x under splitter.

![Add_Splitter](img/add_splitter_en.png?raw=true "Add Splitter")

Here as manufacturer enter _Logitech_ and select _Logitech Harmony Hub_.

![Add Logitech Hub](img/add_splitter_en_1.png?raw=true "Add Logitech Hub")


In the window that opens, first select the following items during initial installation:

![Logitech Hub 1](img/logitech_hub_1.png?raw=true "Logitech Hub 1")


**1.** put slider on active. This is necessary for the I / O instance to be active later.

**2.** Enter the IP address of the Logitech Harmony Hub

**3.** Email address (corresponds to login name) for MyHarmony

**5.** MyHarmony password

**6.** Then press _APPLY CHANGES_ .

![Accept Changes](img/apply_changes_en.png?raw=true "Accept Changes")

**7.** Select _Read Configuration_ and wait a few seconds.

![Logitech Hub 2](img/logitech_hub_2.png?raw=true "Logitech Hub 2")

**8.** After the _Harmony Config_ variable has been updated, press _Setup Harmony_, then the instance can be closed.

Then a configurator is created.

![Konfigurator 1](img/configurator.png?raw=true "Configurator 1")

![Konfigurator 2](img/configurator_2.png?raw=true "Configurator 2")

The configurator now offers the following options:

![Konfigurator 3](img/configurator_3.png?raw=true "Configurator 3")


- _category harmony scripts_ is the category under which scripts are created
- _Harmony variables_ if not active only the instance is created, but scripts can still be used. Activate to switch over variables in the web front. _Attention! Many devices can consume many variables_.
  _Optional_ If this option is selected, a variable for switching from the web front will be created for each command group of a Logitech Harmony device. **CAUTION:** This option should **only be selected if there are still enough variables available in IP-Symcon** or the number of variables is unlimited, as a large number of variables can be consumed depending on the devices learned in the Harmony Hub. Every Harmony Hub device creates a variable for switching in the web front for each Controllgroup stored in the Harmony Hub. Depending on the number of devices configured in the Harmony Hub, a large number of variables may be generated here.
  The option is intended for IP Symcon users who still have enough variables available and want to drop commands from the web front.	
- _Harmony script_ If this is activated, the associated scripts will be created for each already created instance with _Setup Harmony_.
  _Optional_ This option can be chosen as an alternative or addition to variables. A subcategory with scripts is created for each Controllgroup stored in the Harmony Hub.
  The single script then sends the respective command (script name) to the Logitech Harmony Hub.

If something has been changed in the configuration in the Harmony Hub, press _Read Configuration_ and press _Refresh List_.
Individual devices can now be selected in the configurator and _Create_ creates the device in IP-Symcon.


![Konfigurator 4](img/configurator_4.png?raw=true "Configurator 4")

Mit _Setup Harmony_ , scripts are created for each device created in IP Symcon, depending on the settings (see above), and scripts are generated for the activities.

### Webfront Screen

![Webfront](img/Webfront.png?raw=true "Webfront")

You can then send commands via the web front or the scripts. The activity is displayed on the web front.
Once a device or Harmony Remote triggers a Harmony Activity, it will also be updated in IP Symcon.
The current activity is displayed in the variable Harmony Activity, which is located under the Logitech Harmony Splitter. A link under the category selected above is automatically created for this variable.

The variable names and the name of the commands are created as they are stored by the name in the Harmony Hub. For each created variable also the description field is used, here stands the actual command inside which is sent to the Harmony Hub. Therefore, the description field of the variable must not be changed. The name of the variable as well as the command names that are stored in the variable profile of the variable can be customized by the user. However, the order in the variable profile should not change
